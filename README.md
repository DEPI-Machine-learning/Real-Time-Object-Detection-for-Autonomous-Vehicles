# Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles 🚗🔍  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a **real-time object detection model** for autonomous vehicles using the **KITTI dataset**. The model identifies **pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles** to enhance navigation, safety, and decision-making. It tackles challenges such as **lighting variations, diverse road conditions, and environmental factors** to ensure reliable performance in real-world scenarios.  

## 🔹 Key Features  
- **Real-time detection** of objects relevant to autonomous driving  
- **KITTI dataset** for training and evaluation  
- **Preprocessing techniques**: Image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation  
- **Deep learning-based detection models** (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, etc.)  
- **Scalable & efficient pipeline** for autonomous vehicle applications  

## 📂 Dataset  
We use the **KITTI dataset**, which includes:  
- High-resolution images captured from real-world driving scenarios  
- Labeled bounding boxes for **vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and road objects**  

## 🚀 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection & Exploration**  
   - Load KITTI dataset and analyze object distribution  
   - Evaluate image quality, label accuracy, and environmental conditions  
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Resize images (e.g., 416x416 for YOLO)  
   - Normalize pixel values for improved model convergence  
   - Apply data augmentation (cropping, flipping, rotation)  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Train an object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN)  
   - Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning  

4. **Evaluation & Deployment**  
   - Test model accuracy and robustness  
   - Deploy for real-time inference in autonomous driving systems
